The Mitigation Working Group Micocontroller Code

Description

This code is part of the mitigation working group code base to be used
for testing microprocessors and FPGAs.  This specific code is the code
developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for testing
microcontrollers.  This code includes a handful of codes that can be
used to test microcontrollers for accelerated radiation tests.  This
version of the code includes: AES, LANL cache test, matrix multiply
and quicksort.  We also use CoreMark for testing purposes, which can
be found here: http://www.eembc.org/coremark/index.php.
